## Overview

Run Tensorboard from the context menu of file (`*.tfevents.*`) or directory in Team Files.

# How To Use

1. Run app from the context menu of directory of file in **Team Files** -> `Run app` -> `Tensorboard`

2. Wait for the app to import your data (project will be created in the current workspace)
